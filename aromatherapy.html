            <p>
              <h5>Lemongrass</h5>
              This multipurpose oil has a calming aroma that smells like a mixture of lemon and rose
that can be an effective tool for reducing stress-related symptoms.  This aromatherapy
mixture is designed to relieve stress and calm the nerves. With its rejuvenating powers,
lemongrass oil reduces problems associated with jet-lag, concentration, headaches, and
other fatigue-related symptoms.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              <h5>Peppermint</h5>
              This cooling and refreshing essential oil is used in aromatherapy to stimulate the mind,
increase mental agility and to increase focus, while cooling the skin, reducing redness
and calming irritation and itchiness.

            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              <h5>Orange California</h5>
              Treat yourself to an uplifting experience! One can inhale the sweet scent and immediately
feel its warming, uplifting properties. This essential oil is used for treatment of
depression, anxiety, moodiness, stress and frustration.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              <h5>Pure French Lavender</h5>
              Considered the universal oil, lavender essential oil has soothing, calming, and restorative
properties. The essential oil is antiseptic, cooling and mild.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              <h5>Ylang-Ylang</h5>
              Ylang-Ylang means "Flower of Flowers". The essential oil has a sweet, flowery jasmine like
aroma and is a romantic favorite. It is extremely calming and relaxing and may help with
releasing feelings of anger, tension and nervous irritability.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              <h5>Chocolate</h5>
              Everyone loves chocolate. The scent of chocolate triggers the release
of chemicals in the brain that produce a similar feeling as when one first falls in love.  In
addition to being a sensory indulgence, chocolate contains over
300 different compounds some of which can have a significant impact on
one's health and beauty. Theobromine, a substance very similar to caffeine produces a
slimming effect on the body; (magnesium, potassium and calcium)
have a calming effect, therefore reducing stress; and polyphenols,
antioxidants that thwart free radicals which are responsible for cell aging.
Imagine all of these benefits derived from the pleasures of chocolate.
